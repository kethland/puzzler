GW - Futhark Decryption Model
This is a convolutional neural network model trained on the Futhark alphabet to decrypt messages encoded using Futhark. The model was trained using two datasets: RIMES and FUTHARK1.

Installation
To use this model, clone this repository and install the required packages by running:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the model, simply run the main.py script. This script loads the trained model and performs decryption on a pre-defined message. You can modify the message to be decrypted by editing the message variable in the main function.
